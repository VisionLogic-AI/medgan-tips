A few additional works and tips on Edward Choi's medGAN
=====================

In this repository, I share my own work that is based on [Edward Choi](https://github.com/mp2893/)'s [medGAN](https://github.com/mp2893/medgan). Congrats to Edward's excellent work!

medGAN is a generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating electronic health records (EHR).
