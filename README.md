A few additional tips on Edward Choi's medGAN.
=====================

In this repository, I share my work that is based on [Edward Choi](https://github.com/mp2893/)'s [medGAN](https://github.com/mp2893/medgan). Congrats to Edward's excellent work!

medGAN is a generative adversarial network for generating electronic health records.
