A few additional works and tips on Edward Choi's medGAN
=====================

In this repository, I share my own work that is based on [Edward Choi](https://github.com/mp2893/)'s [medGAN](https://github.com/mp2893/medgan). Congrats to Edward's excellent work!

medGAN is a generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating electronic health records (EHR). medGAN implements the algorithm introduced in the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06490):

	Generating Multi-label Discrete Patient Records using Generative Adversarial Networks

### My own `medgan` repository's contents:
1. `tips-for-medgan.md`: [A few additional tips on how to run Edward Choi's medGAN](https://github.com/sylvaincom/medgan/blob/master/tips-for-medgan.md). In this markdown, I add a few tips that complete Edward Choi's `README.md` of his medGAN repository.
2. `how-medgan-binary-works.ipynb`: [Understanding how medGAN works (wtih binary variables)](https://github.com/sylvaincom/medgan/blob/master/how-medgan-binary-works.ipynb). In this notebook, I provide a few code cells and explanations that can help better understand and run medGAN on binary variables.
